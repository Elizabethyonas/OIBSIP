**# Task-1 Iris Flower Classification Using Machine Learning**
## Introduction
Iris flower has 3 species Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica, which differs according to their measurements. The objective is to develop a model that can accurately classify Iris flowers based on their measurements.
## Requirements
* **This project is done on google colab**
* **Python libraries like:**
  * **numpy**
  * **matplotlib.pyplot**
  * **pandas**
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the famous dataset which is commonly used for classification tasks. It includes sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width for 150 flower, with 50 samples for each species.
## Model training 
In this project Logistics regression training model is used.

**# task-2 Unemployment Analysis Using Python**
## Introduction
This repository contains a data science project aimed at analyzing the unemployment rate, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. Unemployment is an important economic indicator that measures the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labor force. By studying and understanding the trends and factors affecting unemployment, we can gain valuable insights into the job market and the broader economy.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the unemployment rate during the Covid-19 pandemic. The project will involve collecting relevant data, cleaning and preprocessing the data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## Requirements
* **This project is done on google colab**
* **Python libraries:**
  * **numpy**
  * **pandas**
 
**# task-3 Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning**
## Introduction
Car price depends on different factors such as brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and other factors. The goal of this project is to predict the price of car given specific conditions.
## Requirements
* **This project is done on google colab**
* **Python libraries like:**
  * **matplotlib.pyplot**
  * **pandas**
  * **seaborn**
## Model training
In this project we use label encoder to lable the data and logistics regression to train.

**# task-5 Sales Prediction Using Python**
## Introduction
Sales prediction is an important part of modern business intelligence. It can be a complex problem, especially in the case of lack of data, missing data, and the presence of outliers. Sales prediction is rather a regression problem than a time series problem. Practice shows that the use of regression approaches can often give us better results compared to time series methods. Machine-learning algorithms make it possible to find patterns in the time series. We can find complicated patterns in the sales dynamics, using supervised machine-learning methods. Some of the most popular are tree-based machine-learning algorithms.
## Requirements
* **This project is done on google colab**
* **Python libraries like:**
  * **matplotlib.pyplot**
  * **pandas**
  * **numpy**
## Model training
In this project we use standard scaler to scale and lable the data and logistics regression to train.
